[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a platform which provides an online computing sources to develop and work on coding projects, or even to teach coding or specific topics like modeling-simulations of materials in the schools.
[Quantum Espresso (QE)](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/)[[1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/21/39/395502/meta?casa_token=g1evgUWAyAAAAAAA:PBNGb3BGEogp8Uq9leLCquTamf_lSoWY6TnAvDilAbX4iAts9OQIpkqhi6l-8f9fHpglr6hDtw)] is a widely-used open-source materials modeling software at nanoscale by performing [density functional theory (DFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory). DFT is the fundamental step in multiscale materials modelling (please see the figure below, taken from [[2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40544-018-0207-9)]). The most preferred method to use QE is installing it on a local computer together with necessary files (input, pseudopotentials) and packages/libraries like AiiDA or gnuplot, and executing the every command through the terminal.

This repository includes an example notebook showing how to install and use QE on Colab. This might be a quite useful go-to method for especially educational purposes of atomistic modeling in the schools. It just needs the necessary files to be uploaded on the Colab directory, "Files" section on the left menu. Another advantage is to be able to modify the input file seamlessly and run the simulation afterwards.
